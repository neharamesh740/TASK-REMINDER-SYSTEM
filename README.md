The Task Reminder System is a Python-based application designed to help users efficiently manage tasks and track deadlines. Users can add tasks with specific due dates, and the system automatically identifies tasks approaching their deadlines using Python’s datetime module. Each task is represented as an object with a name and deadline, following an object-oriented approach that ensures clean, modular, and maintainable code. The system highlights tasks due within the next three days, allowing users to prioritize urgent tasks and plan their schedules effectively. It is suitable for students, professionals, and organizations to manage assignments, meetings, projects, or daily activities. The application can be extended with additional features such as email or desktop notifications, database storage, recurring tasks, and a graphical user interface using frameworks like Tkinter, Flask, or Django. Overall, the Task Reminder System is a practical solution for improving productivity, time management, and organization by providing clear visibility of upcoming tasks and deadlines.
